R scripts for a reproducible analysis of logistic growth

1) The analysis allowed us to plot and model linearly the logistic growth pattern of bacteria in an abundance of growth media. The model led us to an estimate of the initial population of the bacteria suspended in the media. It also allowed us to plot the relationship between time and the change in abundance of bacteria, and from this we were able to estimate the growth rate in different phases of the logistic growth curve. The models provided...
  Estimates of the initial population, the carrying capacity, and the growth rate:
  For experiment 1:
  N0= exp(6.883)
    = 975.54 (2d.p)
  r= 1.004e-02
  K= 6.000e+10

2)For exponential growth, N (t) = N0e^(rt)
                                = 975.54e^(0.01004*4980)
                                =1059.22
If the growth was capped at the carrying capacity, we would expect it to have reached 6*10^10 by t=4980. This is much higher than the calculated growth?
